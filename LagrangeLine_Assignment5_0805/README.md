#Lagrange Polynomial Line - Assignment 5 - 08/05/2024
Problem statement: Input values = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] and the corresponding Output values = [7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7]. Our aim is to find a lagrange polynomial function and plot the lagrange line for the same.<br>

Solution: We are supposed to form find the lagrange polynomial and substitute <br>

Code: Refer lagrangeline.py in LagrangeLine_Assignment5_0805 folder <br>
To install required libraries:
```
pip install matplotlib, mpl_toolkits, numpy
```
Move into the LagrangeLine_Assignment5_0805
```
cd LagrangeLine_Assignment5_0805/
```
Run the python file
```
python3 lagrangeline.py
```
Note: The folder path conventions and other details followed are respect to Linux OS, users using Windows OS are required to change file paths and other requirements as needed for Windows OS. <br>

Output: Lagrange Polynomial Line for the set of points is plotted on the graph.<br>
